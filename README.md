Huffman Coding Implementation in Java
This repository contains a Java implementation of Huffman coding, a popular algorithm used for lossless data compression.

Overview
Huffman coding works by assigning variable-length codes to input characters, where the length of each code depends on the character's frequency of occurrence in the input data. This implementation includes methods to encode and decode messages using Huffman coding, as well as utilities for file input/output operations.

Features
Encoder and Decoder: Efficient encoding and decoding of messages using Huffman coding.
File I/O: Methods for reading input from files, encoding the data, and writing the encoded data to files.
Priority Queue: Utilizes Java's PriorityQueue for constructing the Huffman tree.
